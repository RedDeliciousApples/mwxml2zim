An '''apple''' is a round, edible [[fruit]] produced by an '''apple tree''' ('''''Malus domestica'''''). Apple [[fruit tree|trees]] are [[agriculture|cultivated]] worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the [[genus]] ''[[Malus]]''. The [[tree]] originated in [[Central Asia]], where its wild ancestor, ''[[Malus sieversii]]'', is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North America by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]]. Apples have [[Religion|religious]] and [[mythology|mythological]] significance in many cultures, including [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], and [[Christianity in Europe|European Christian]] tradition.

Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple [[cultivar]]s are propagated by clonal [[grafting]] onto [[rootstock]]s. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.

There are more than 7,500 [[List of apple cultivars|cultivars of apples]]. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including [[cooking apple|cooking]], eating raw, and [[apple cider|cider]] production. Trees and fruit are prone to [[fungus|fungal]], bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of [[organic farming|organic]] and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's [[genome]] was [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.

Worldwide production of apples in 2021 was 93 million [[tonnes]], with China accounting for nearly half of the total.&lt;ref name=faostat/&gt;

==Etymology==

The word ''apple'', whose [[Old English]] ancestor is {{lang|ang-Latn|æppel}}, is descended from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] noun {{lang|gem-x-proto|*aplaz}}, descended in turn from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{lang|ine-x-proto|*h₂ébōl}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2021-07-06 |title=Where the word 'apple' came from and why the apple was unlucky to be linked to the fall of man |url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/3139890/where-word-apple-came-and-why-forbidden-fruit-was-unlucky |access-date=2023-06-28 |website=South China Morning Post |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit including [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s—such as the 14th-century [[Middle English]] expression {{lang|enm|appel of paradis}}, meaning a [[banana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Origin and meaning of "apple" by Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/apple |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=22 November 2019 |archive-date=21 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221020212/https://www.etymonline.com/word/apple |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Apple's composition.svg|thumb|left|Apple [[plant morphology|morphology]]]]
[[File:Koeh-108.jpg|thumb|left|Blossoms, fruits, and leaves of the apple tree (''Malus domestica'')]]
The apple is a [[deciduous]] tree, generally standing {{convert|6|to|15|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip|round=0.5}} tall in cultivation and up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip|round=0.5}} in the wild.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |title=Types and names of Apple Trees, Species of the Malus Genus |publisher=Treenames.net |access-date=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915015547/http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |archive-date=15 September 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by [[rootstock]] selection and trimming method. The leaves are [[leaf arrangement|alternately arranged]] dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;
[[File:Apple Blossom @ Manali.jpg|thumb|Apple blossom]]

[[Blossoms]] are produced in [[Spring (season)|spring]] simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some long [[Shoot (botany)|shoot]]s. The {{convert|3|to|4|cm|in|abbr=on|sp=us|frac=2}} flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five [[petal]]ed, with an [[inflorescence]] consisting of a [[cyme (botany)|cyme]] with 4–6 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/british-natural-history/urban-tree-survey/identify-trees/tree-factsheets/a-to-b/apple/ |title=Apple |publisher=Natural History Museum |access-date=5 September 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105062530/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/british-natural-history/urban-tree-survey/identify-trees/tree-factsheets/a-to-b/apple/ |archive-date=5 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fruit]] is a [[pome]] that matures in late [[summer]] or [[autumn]], and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is {{convert|2+3/4|to|3+1/4|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip|round=0.5}} in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples less than {{convert|2+1/4|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip|round=0.5}} are generally used for juicing and have little fresh market value.
==== Skin ====

The groundcolor of ripe apples is yellow, green, yellow-green or whitish yellow. The overcolor of ripe apples can be orange-red, pink-red, red, purple-red or brown-red. The skin can also be [[russetted]]. The overcolor amount can be 0-100%. &lt;ref name=Janick&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/pri/chapter.pdf |page=9 |chapter=Chapter 1: Apples |author1=Janick, Jules |author2=Cummins, James N. |author3=Brown, Susan K. |author4=Hemmat, Minou |title=Fruit Breeding, Volume I: Tree and Tropical Fruits |editor1=Jules Janick |editor2=James N.

===Wild ancestors===
{{Main|Malus sieversii}}
The original wild ancestor of ''Malus domestica'' was ''Malus sieversii'', found growing wild in the [[mountains of Central Asia]] in southern [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Xinjiang|northwestern China]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref name="Architecture and size relations: an essay on the apple (Malus x domestica, Rosaceae) tree"/&gt; Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the [[Tian Shan]] mountains, progressed over a long period of time and permitted secondary [[introgression]] of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with ''[[Malus sylvestris]]'', the crabapple, resulted in populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar progenitor ''Malus sieversii''. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=New Insight into the History of Domesticated Apple: Secondary Contribution of the European Wild Apple to the Genome of Cultivated Varieties |author=Cornille, Amandine |journal=PLOS Genetics |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002703 |year=2012 |editor1-last=Mauricio |editor1-first=Rodney |last2=Gladieux |first2=Pierre |last3=Smulders |first3=Marinus J.

=== Aroma in apples ===
Important volatile compounds in apples include [[acetaldehyde]], [[ethyl acetate]], [[butyraldehyde|1-butanal]], [[ethanol]], 2-methylbutanal, [[isovaleraldehyde|3-methylbutanal]], [[ethyl propionate]], ethyl 2-methylpropionate, [[ethyl butyrate]], ethyl 2-methyl butyrate, [[hexanal]], [[1-butanol]], [[isoamyl acetate|3-methylbutyl acetate]], 2-methylbutyl acetate, 1-propyl butyrate, [[ethyl pentanoate]], [[amyl acetate]], [[2-methyl-1-butanol]], trans-2-hexenal, [[ethyl hexanoate]], [[hexanol]]. &lt;ref&gt;Flath.

===Genome===
Apples are diploid (though triploid cultivars are not uncommon), have 17 chromosomes and an estimated [[genome]] size of approximately 650 Mb. Several whole genome sequences have been completed and made available. The first one in 2010 was based on the diploid cultivar '[[Golden Delicious]]'.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=The genome of the domesticated apple (''Malus'' × ''domestica'' Borkh.)|journal=Nature Genetics |doi=10.1038/ng.654 |last1=Velasco |first1=Riccardo|last2=Zharkikh|first2=Andrey|last3=Affourtit|first3=Jason|last4=Dhingra|first4=Amit|last5=Cestaro|first5=Alessandro|last6=Kalyanaraman|first6=Ananth|last7=Fontana|first7=Paolo|last8=Bhatnagar|first8=Satish K. |last9=Troggio|first9=Michela|last10=Pruss|first10=Dmitry|last11=Salvi|first11=Silvio|last12=Pindo|first12=Massimo|last13=Baldi|first13=Paolo|last14=Castelletti|first14=Sara|last15=Cavaiuolo|first15=Marina|last16=Coppola |first16=Giuseppina|last17=Costa|first17=Fabrizio|last18=Cova|first18=Valentina|last19=Dal Ri|first19=Antonio|last20=Goremykin|first20=Vadim|last21=Komjanc|first21=Matteo|last22=Longhi|first22=Sara|last23=Magnago|first23=Pierluigi |last24=Malacarne|first24=Giulia|last25=Malnoy|first25=Mickael|last26=Micheletti|first26=Diego|last27=Moretto|first27=Marco|last28=Perazzolli|first28=Michele|last29=Si-Ammour|first29=Azeddine|last30=Vezzulli|first30=Silvia |volume=42|issue=10|pages=833–839|pmid=20802477|s2cid=14854514|display-authors=29|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this first whole genome sequence turned out to contain several errors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=A high-density, multi-parental SNP genetic map on apple validates a new mapping approach for outcrossing species|publisher=Nature Horticulture Research|doi=10.1038/hortres.2016.57|last1=Di Pierro|first1=Erica A.|last2=Gianfranceschi |first2=Luca|last3=Di Guardo|first3=Mario|last4=Koehorst-Van Putten|first4=Herma JJ|last5=Kruisselbrink|first5=Johannes W.|last6=Longhi|first6=Sara|last7=Troggio|first7=Michela|last8=Bianco|first8=Luca|last9=Muranty|first9=Hélène |last10=Pagliarani|first10=Giulia|last11=Tartarini|first11=Stefano|last12=Letschka|first12=Thomas|last13=Lozano Luis|first13=Lidia|last14=Garkava-Gustavsson|first14=Larisa|last15=Micheletti|first15=Diego|last16=Bink|first16=Marco CAM|last17=Voorrips|first17=Roeland E.|last18=Aziz|first18=Ebrahimi|last19=Velasco|first19=Riccardo|last20=Laurens|first20=François|last21=Van De Weg|first21=W Eric|journal=Horticulture Research|volume=3|issue=1 |page=16057|pmid=27917289 |pmc=5120355}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part owing to the high degree of [[heterozygosity]] in diploid apples which, in combination with an ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly.

Re-sequencing of multiple accessions has supported this, while also suggesting extensive introgression from ''Malus sylvestris'' following domestication.&lt;ref name="naturesize"/&gt;

''[[Malus sieversii]]'' is recognized as a major progenitor species to the cultivated apple, and is morphologically similar.

Chinese soft apples, such as ''[[M. asiatica]]'' and ''[[M. prunifolia]]'', have been cultivated as dessert apples for more than 2000 years in China. These are thought to be hybrids between ''M. baccata'' and ''M. sieversii'' in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="naturesize" /&gt;

Among the traits selected for by human growers are size, fruit acidity, color, firmness, and soluble sugar. Unusually for domesticated fruits, the wild ''M. sieversii'' origin is only slightly smaller than the modern domesticated apple.&lt;ref name="naturesize" /&gt;

At the Sammardenchia-Cueis site near Udine in Northeastern Italy, seeds from some form of apples have been found in material carbon dated to around 4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins and Spread of Domestic Plants in Southwest Asia and Europe|editor1=Colledge, Sue |editor2=Conolly, James |date=2016-06-16 |publisher=Left Coast Press |isbn=9781598749885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic analysis has not yet been successfully used to determine whether such ancient apples were wild ''Malus sylvestris'' or ''Malus domesticus'' containing ''Malus sieversii'' ancestry.&lt;ref name="appledna"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Towards the onset of fruit tree growing north of the Alps: Ancient DNA from waterlogged apple (''Malus'' sp.) seed fragments |doi=10.1016/j.aanat.2011.03.004 |pmid=21501956|author=Schlumbauma, Angela |author2=van Glabeke, Sabine |author3=Roldan-Ruiz, Isabel |journal=Annals of Anatomy - Anatomischer Anzeiger|volume=194|pages=157–162 |year=2012|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally also hard to distinguish in the archeological record between foraged wild apples and apple plantations.

Apple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, as well as being cultivated on colonial farms.

==Significance in European cultures and societies==
{{Main|Apple (symbolism)}}

===Germanic paganism===
[[File:Carl Larsson Brita as Iduna.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Illustration of girl in a red dress, holding 3 candles in one hand and a basket of apples in the other|"Brita as [[Iðunn|Iduna]]" (1901) by [[Carl Larsson]]]]
In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Iðunn]] is portrayed in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' (written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) as providing apples to the [[gods]] that give them [[eternal youth]]fulness. The English scholar [[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] links apples to religious practices in [[Germanic paganism]], from which [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the [[Oseberg ship]] burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'') have been found in the early graves of the [[Germanic peoples]] in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of [[fertility]] in southwest England.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Davidson notes a connection between apples and the [[Vanir]], a tribe of gods associated with [[fertility]] in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven "golden apples" being given to woo the beautiful [[Gerðr]] by [[Skírnir]], who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god [[Freyr]] in stanzas 19 and 20 of ''[[Skírnismál]]''. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'': when the major goddess [[Frigg]] sends King [[Rerir]] an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a [[tumulus|mound]].&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON165-166"/&gt; Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the birth (by [[Caesarean section]]) of their son—the hero [[Völsung]].&lt;ref name="DAVIDSONROLES146-147"/&gt;

Further, Davidson points out the "strange" phrase "Apples of [[Hel (location)|Hel]]" used in an 11th-century poem by the [[skald]] Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess [[Nehalennia]] is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the [[Roman Empire]] and came to Europe from the [[Near East]], the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn "we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

===Greek mythology===
[[File:Hercules Musei Capitolini MC1265 n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Heracles]] with the apple of [[Hesperides]]]]
Apples appear in many [[World religions|religious traditions]], often as a mystical or [[forbidden fruit]]. One of the problems identifying apples in religion, [[mythology]] and [[Folklore|folktales]] is that the word "apple" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 17th century.&lt;ref name="app3"/&gt; For instance, in [[Greek mythology]], the [[Greek hero]] [[Heracles]], as a part of his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]], was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Tree of Life]] growing at its center.&lt;ref name=book1&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasson |first=R.

The Greek goddess of discord, [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html |title=Fabulae |author=Hyginus |chapter=92 |chapter-url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html#92 |translator=Mary Grant |website=Theoi Project |access-date=7 December 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209204358/http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html |archive-date=9 February 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, she tossed a [[Apple of Discord|golden apple]] inscribed [[Kallisti|Καλλίστη]] (''Kalliste'', sometimes transliterated ''Kallisti'', "For the most beautiful one"), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]]. [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of [[Troy]] was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of [[Sparta]]. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lucian |title=Dialogues of the Gods |url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/LucianDialoguesGods1.html |chapter=The Judgement of Paris |chapter-url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/LucianDialoguesGods1.html#0 |translator=H.

The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, sacred to Aphrodite. To throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edmonds |first=J.M. |editor1-first=John M. |editor1-last=Cooper |editor2-last=Hutchinson |editor2-first=D.S. |chapter=Epigrams |title=Plato: Complete Works |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fv9AKY_DBVYC&amp;pg=PR5 |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co. |publication-date=1997 |page=[https://archive.org/details/completeworks00plat/page/1744 1744] |isbn=9780872203495 |year=1997 |access-date=10 September 2020 |archive-date=13 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210113180159/https://books.google.com/books?id=Fv9AKY_DBVYC&amp;pg=PR5 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atalanta]], also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but [[Hippomenes]] (also known as [[Melanion]], a name possibly derived from ''melon'', the Greek word for both "apple" and fruit in general),&lt;ref name=book2/&gt; who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.&lt;ref name=book1/&gt;

Though the forbidden fruit of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] is not identified, popular Christian tradition has held that it was an apple that [[Eve]] coaxed [[Adam]] to share with her.&lt;ref name="book7"/&gt; The origin of the popular identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in wordplay with the [[Latin language|Latin]] words ''mālum'' (an apple) and ''mălum'' (an evil), each of which is normally written ''malum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lotBnvqdmeQC&amp;q=Genesis+apple&amp;pg=PA193 |first=Paul J |last=Kissling |title=Genesis |publisher=College Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-89900875-2 |volume=1 |page=193 |access-date=6 October 2020 |archive-date=26 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126053142/https://books.google.com/books?id=lotBnvqdmeQC&amp;q=Genesis+apple&amp;pg=PA193 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree of the forbidden fruit is called "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" in Genesis 2:17,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|2:17|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Latin for "good and evil" is ''bonum et malum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBPpIHwcZMUC&amp;q=Genesis+apple+malum&amp;pg=PA114 |first=Ronald |last=Hendel |title=The Book of Genesis: A Biography |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-69114012-4 |page=114 |access-date=6 October 2020 |archive-date=29 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220129224931/https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Book_of_Genesis/xBPpIHwcZMUC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=Genesis+apple+malum&amp;pg=PA114&amp;printsec=frontcover |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance]] painters may also have been influenced by the story of the [[golden apple]]s in the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Garden of Hesperides]]. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. The [[larynx]] in the human throat has been called the "[[Adam's apple]]" because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of Adam.&lt;ref name="book7" /&gt; The apple as symbol of sexual [[seduction]] has been used to imply human sexuality, possibly in an ironic vein.&lt;ref name=book7/&gt;

===Proverb===
The [[proverb]], "[[An apple a day keeps the doctor away]]", addressing the supposed health benefits of the fruit, has been traced to 19th-century [[Wales]], where the original phrase was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread".&lt;ref name=Taggart&gt;{{cite book|last=Mieder|first=Wolfgang|title=A Dictionary of American Proverbs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AbJ1tVGmiTgC&amp;pg=PR54|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-505399-9|pages=54–|access-date=9 January 2021|archive-date=29 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220129224931/https://books.google.com/books?id=AbJ1tVGmiTgC&amp;pg=PR54|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century and early 20th, the phrase evolved to "an apple a day, no doctor to pay" and "an apple a day sends the doctor away"; the phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollan |first=Michael |title=The Botany of Desire: a Plant's-eye View of the World |year=2001 |isbn=978-0375501296 |page=[https://archive.org/details/botanyofdesirepl00poll/page/22 22, cf. p. 9 &amp; 50] |publisher=Random House |url=https://archive.org/details/botanyofdesirepl00poll/page/22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK's national fruit collection database contains much information on the characteristics and origin of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same "genetic" apple cultivar. Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking ([[cooking apple]]s) or producing [[cider]]. [[Cider apple]]s are typically too tart and astringent to eat fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.&lt;ref name="apples1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://casfs.ucsc.edu/publications/news%20and%20notes/Fall_06_N&amp;N.pdf  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811154017/http://casfs.ucsc.edu/publications/news%20and%20notes/Fall_06_N%26N.pdf  |url-status=dead  |archive-date=11 August 2007 |title=Autumn Apple Musings |access-date=24 January 2008 |pages=1–2 |author=Tarjan, Sue |publisher=News &amp; Notes of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems |date=Fall 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp.

Some find them to have better flavor than modern cultivars,&lt;ref name="Crops &amp; Gardening - Apples of Antiquity"/&gt; but they may have other problems that make them commercially unviable—low yield, disease susceptibility, poor tolerance for storage or transport, or just being the "wrong" size. A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the United Kingdom, old cultivars such as '[[Cox's Orange Pippin]]' and '[[Egremont Russet]]' are still commercially important even though by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease.&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uga.edu/fruit/apple.html |title=Origin, History of cultivation |access-date=22 January 2008 |publisher=[[University of Georgia]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121045236/http://www.uga.edu/fruit/apple.html |archive-date=21 January 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==

===Breeding===

[[File:Apfelbaum Winterrambour Hochstamm.jpg|thumb|An apple tree in Germany]]

Many apples grow readily from seeds. However, more than with most perennial fruits, apples must be propagated asexually to obtain the sweetness and other desirable characteristics of the parent. This is because seedling apples are an example of "[[Zygosity|extreme heterozygotes]]", in that rather than inheriting genes from their parents to create a new apple with parental characteristics, they are instead significantly different from their parents, perhaps to compete with the many pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] and [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|John Mitchinson]] |title=QI: The Complete First Series – QI Factoids |medium=DVD |publisher=2 entertain |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyploid|Triploid]] cultivars have an additional reproductive barrier in that three sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed (apples are an example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Thomas G. |last=Ranney |url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/fletcher/programs/nursery/metria/metria11/ranney/index.html |title=Polyploidy: From Evolution to Landscape Plant Improvement |book-title=Proceedings of the 11th Metropolitan Tree Improvement Alliance (METRIA) Conference |conference=11th Metropolitan Tree Improvement Alliance (METRIA) Conference held in Gresham, Oregon, August 23–24, 2000 |conference-url=https://www.ces.ncsu.edu/fletcher/programs/nursery/metria/metria11/index.html |website=METRIA (NCSU.edu) |publisher=METRIA |access-date=7 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723170402/http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/fletcher/programs/nursery/metria/metria11/ranney/index.html |archive-date=23 July 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because apples are not [[True-breeding organism|true breeders]] when planted as seeds, although [[cutting (plant)|cutting]]s can take root and breed true, and may live for a century, [[grafting]] is usually used. The [[rootstock]] used for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf rootstocks can be used to produce very small trees (less than {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=or}} high at maturity), which bear fruit many years earlier in their life cycle than full size trees, and are easier to harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extension.unh.edu/resources/files/resource000583_rep605.pdf |title=Dwarf Rootstocks for Apple Trees in the Home Garden |publisher=University of New Hampshire |author1=Lord, William G. |author2=Ouellette, Amy |date=February 2010 |access-date=1 September 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930151829/http://extension.unh.edu/resources/files/Resource000583_Rep605.pdf |archive-date=30 September 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwarf rootstocks for apple trees can be traced as far back as 300 BCE, to the area of [[Persia]] and [[Asia Minor]]. [[Alexander the Great]] sent samples of dwarf apple trees to [[Aristotle]]'s [[Lyceum]]. Dwarf rootstocks became common by the 15th century and later went through several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Importance of Apple Rootstocks on Tree Growth, Yield, Fruit Quality, Leaf Nutrition, and Photosynthesis with an Emphasis on 'Fuji' |author1=Fallahi, Esmaeil |author2=Colt, W.

The [[East Malling Research Station]] conducted extensive research into rootstocks, and their rootstocks are given an "M" prefix to designate their origin. Rootstocks marked with an "MM" prefix are Malling-series cultivars later crossed with trees of '[[Northern Spy]]' in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/hil/hil-300-a.html |title=Apple Rootstocks and Tree Spacing |date=September 1993 |access-date=1 September 2013 |author=Parker, ML |publisher=North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911051127/http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/hil/hil-300-a.html |archive-date=11 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most new apple cultivars originate as seedlings, which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately crossing cultivars with promising characteristics.&lt;ref name=book9&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferree |first=David Curtis |author2=Warrington, Ian J. |title=Apples: Botany, Production and Uses |publisher=CABI Publishing |isbn=978-0-85199-357-7 |year=1999 |oclc=182530169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words "seedling", "pippin", and "kernel" in the name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling. Apples can also form [[bud sport]]s (mutations on a single branch). Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar. Some differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars.&lt;ref name=app4&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheets/HGIC1350.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228131352/http://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheets/HGIC1350.htm |archive-date=28 February 2008 |title=Apple |access-date=22 January 2008 |author=Polomski, Bob |author2=Reighard, Greg |publisher=Clemson University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1930s, the Excelsior Experiment Station at the [[University of Minnesota]] has introduced a steady progression of important apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by local orchardists, throughout [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]]. Its most important contributions have included '[[Haralson (apple)|Haralson]]' (which is the most widely cultivated apple in Minnesota), '[[Wealthy (apple)|Wealthy]]', 'Honeygold', and '[[Honeycrisp]]'.

Apples have been acclimatized in Ecuador at very high altitudes, where they can often, with the needed factors, provide crops twice per year because of constant temperate conditions year-round.&lt;ref name="Apples in Ecuador"/&gt;

===Pollination===
{{See also| Fruit tree pollination}}
[[File:Apple tree blossom.JPG|right|thumb|Apple blossom from an old [[Ayrshire]] cultivar]]
[[File:Orchmason.jpg|thumb|[[Orchard mason bee]] on apple bloom, [[British Columbia]], Canada]]

Apples are self-incompatible; they must [[Pollination|cross-pollinate]] to develop fruit. During the flowering each season, apple growers often utilize [[pollinator]]s to carry pollen. [[Honey bee]]s are most commonly used. [[Osmia lignaria|Orchard mason bees]] are also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. [[Bumblebee]] [[queen bee|queens]] are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in sufficient number to be significant pollinators.&lt;ref name=app4/&gt;&lt;ref name="An Assessment of Non-Apis Bees as Fruit and Vegetable Crop Pollinators in Southwest Virginia"&gt;Adamson, Nancy Lee. [http://www.step-project.net/NPDOCS/Adamson_NL_D_2011.pdf An Assessment of Non-Apis Bees as Fruit and Vegetable Crop Pollinators in Southwest Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120230411/http://www.step-project.net/NPDOCS/Adamson_NL_D_2011.pdf |date=20 November 2015 }}. Diss. 2011. Web. 15 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four to seven pollination groups in apples, depending on climate:
* Group A – Early flowering, 1 to 3 May in England ('[[Gravenstein]]', 'Red Astrachan')
* Group B – 4 to 7 May ('[[Idared]]', '[[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]]')
* Group C – Mid-season flowering, 8 to 11 May ('[[Granny Smith]]', '[[Cox's Orange Pippin]]')
* Group D – Mid/late season flowering, 12 to 15 May ('[[Golden Delicious]]', 'Calville blanc d'hiver')
* Group E – Late flowering, 16 to 18 May ('[[Braeburn]]', 'Reinette d'Orléans')
* Group F – 19 to 23 May ('Suntan')
* Group H – 24 to 28 May ('Court-Pendu Gris' – also called Court-Pendu plat)

One cultivar can be pollinated by a compatible cultivar from the same group or close (A with A, or A with B, but not A with C or D).&lt;ref name="Symposium on Growth Regulators in Fruit Production"/&gt;

Cultivars are sometimes classified by the day of peak bloom in the average 30-day blossom period, with pollenizers selected from cultivars within a 6-day overlap period.

===Maturation and harvest===
{{See also|Fruit picking|Fruit tree pruning}}
[[File:Relander and apples.jpg|thumb|[[L. K. Relander]], the former [[President of Finland]], with his family picking apples in the 1930s]]
Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Some cultivars, if left unpruned, grow very large—letting them bear more fruit, but making harvesting more difficult. Depending on tree density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees typically bear {{convert|40|-|200|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years. Apples are harvested using three-point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches. Trees grafted on dwarfing rootstocks bear about {{convert|10|-|80|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} of fruit per year.&lt;ref name=app4/&gt;

Farms with apple orchards open them to the public so consumers can pick their own apples.&lt;ref name=food/&gt;

Crops ripen at different times of the year according to the cultivar. Cultivar that yield their crop in the summer include 'Gala', 'Golden Supreme', 'McIntosh', 'Transparent', 'Primate', '[[Sweet Bough]]', and 'Duchess'; fall producers include 'Fuji', 'Jonagold', 'Golden Delicious', 'Red Delicious', 'Chenango', 'Gravenstein', 'Wealthy', 'McIntosh', 'Snow', and 'Blenheim'; winter producers include 'Winesap', 'Granny Smith', 'King', 'Wagener', '[[Swazie (apple)|Swayzie]]', 'Greening', and 'Tolman Sweet'.&lt;ref name="lawrence122"/&gt;

===Storage===
[[File:MIN Rungis pommes.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of apple [[List of apple cultivars|cultivars]] in a wholesale food market]]
Commercially, apples can be stored for a few months in [[controlled atmosphere]] chambers to delay [[ethylene]]-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of [[carbon dioxide]] and high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly.

For home storage, most cultivars of apple can be held for approximately two weeks when kept at the coolest part of the refrigerator (i.e. below 5&amp;nbsp;°C). Some can be stored up to a year without significant degradation.{{dubious|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="Yepsen 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yepsen |first=Roger |title=Apples |year=1994 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-03690-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=December 2017}} Some varieties of apples (e.g. '[[Granny Smith]]' and '[[Fuji (apple)|Fuji]]') have more than three times the storage life of others.&lt;ref name="Food Science Australia Fact Sheet: Refrigerated storage of perishable foods"/&gt;

Non-organic apples may be sprayed with a substance [[1-methylcyclopropene]] blocking the apples' ethylene receptors, temporarily preventing them from ripening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Karp |first1=David |title=Puff the Magic Preservative: Lasting Crunch, but Less Scent |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/dining/25fruit.html |access-date=26 July 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=25 October 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803082104/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/dining/25fruit.html |archive-date=3 August 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pests and diseases===
{{Main|List of apple diseases}}
{{See also|List of Lepidoptera that feed on Malus}}
[[File:Apple tree leaves with insect damage.jpg|thumb|Leaves with significant insect damage]]
Apple trees are susceptible to a number of [[fungus|fungal]] and [[bacterium|bacterial]] diseases and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. [[organic farming|Organic]] methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.

A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant. Three of the more common diseases or pests are mildew, aphids, and apple scab.
* [[Mildew]] is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring. The flowers turn a creamy yellow color and do not develop correctly. This can be treated similarly to [[Botryotinia|''Botrytis'']]—eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the infected plants are among recommended actions.&lt;ref name="pest4"/&gt;
* [[Aphids]] are a small insect. Five species of aphids commonly attack apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear).&lt;ref name=pest4/&gt; Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.&lt;ref name=pest5&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umass.edu/fruitadvisor/NEAPMG/index.htm |title=Apple Pest Management Guide |author=Coli, William |access-date=3 March 2008 |publisher=University of Massachusetts Amherst |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212130013/http://www.umass.edu/fruitadvisor/NEAPMG/index.htm |archive-date=12 February 2008 |url-status=live|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Apple scab]]: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also develops similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves on the ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{cite book |title=The Organic Gardener's Handbook of Natural Pest and Disease Control |editor1=Bradley, Fern Marshall |editor2=Ellis, Barbara W. |editor3=Martin, Deborah L. |year=2009 |publisher=Rodale, Inc. |isbn=978-1-60529-677-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/organicgardeners00brad_0/page/32 32–34] |url=https://archive.org/details/organicgardeners00brad_0/page/32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most serious disease problems is a bacterial disease called [[fireblight]], and three fungal diseases: ''[[Gymnosporangium]]'' rust, [[Black Spot (disease)|black spot]],&lt;ref name="pest5" /&gt; and [[Bitter rot of apple|bitter rot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Phillip L. |last2=Krawczyk |first2=Teresa |last3=Khodadadi |first3=Fatemeh |last4=Aćimović |first4=Srđan G. |last5=Peter |first5=Kari A. |date=2021 |title=Bitter Rot of Apple in the Mid-Atlantic United States: Causal Species and Evaluation of the Impacts of Regional Weather Patterns and Cultivar Susceptibility |url=https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PHYTO-09-20-0432-R |journal=Phytopathology |language=en |volume=111 |issue=6 |pages=966–981 |doi=10.1094/PHYTO-09-20-0432-R |pmid=33487025 |s2cid=231701083 |issn=0031-949X|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pests that affect apple trees include [[Codling moth]]s and [[apple maggot]]s.

All parts of the fruit, including the skin, except for the seeds, are suitable for human consumption. The core, from stem to bottom, containing the seeds, is usually not eaten and is discarded.

Apples can be consumed in various ways: [[Apple juice|juice]], raw in salads, baked in [[Apple pie|pies]], cooked into [[Apple sauce|sauces]] and spreads like [[apple butter]], and other [[Cooking apple|baked dishes]].&lt;ref name=applefood/&gt;

Apples are sometimes used as an ingredient in savory foods, such as sausage and stuffing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/apple-of-my-eye-gallery|title=81 Best Apple Recipes: Dinners, Desserts, Salads, and More|first=Kristi|last=Kellogg|website=Epicurious|date=15 January 2015|access-date=17 October 2020|archive-date=18 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018215038/https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/apple-of-my-eye-gallery|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several techniques are used to preserve apples and apple products. Apples can be canned, dried or frozen.&lt;ref name=applefood/&gt; Canned or frozen apples are eventually baked into pies or other cooked dishes. Apple juice or cider is also bottled. Apple juice is often concentrated and frozen.

===Culinary===
Apples are often eaten raw. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or [[table apple]]s. Apples also figure into many traditional or festival occasions. In the UK, a [[toffee apple]] is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot [[toffee]] and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are [[candy apple]]s (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup) and [[caramel apples]] (coated with cooled [[caramel]]) and are usually consumed during the autumn season or Halloween. [[Apples and honey]] are a ritual [[food pairing]] eaten during the Jewish New Year of [[Rosh Hashanah]] to symbolize a sweet new year.

Apples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as [[apple pie]], apple [[crumble]], [[apple crisp]] and [[apple cake]]. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as [[apple sauce]]. Apples are also made into [[apple butter]] and apple jelly. They are often [[baked]] or [[stewed]] and are also (cooked) in some meat dishes. Dried apples can be eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid).

Apples are milled or pressed to produce [[apple juice]], which may be drunk unfiltered (called [[apple cider]] in North America), or filtered. Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen, then reconstituted later and consumed. Apple juice can be [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to make [[cider]] (called hard cider in North America), [[ciderkin]], and vinegar. Through [[distillation]], various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]], [[Calvados (spirit)|Calvados]], and [[apfelwein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edible Medicinal And Non-Medicinal Plants: Volume 4, Fruits|isbn=9789400740532|last1=Lim|first1=T.

===Organic production===
[[organic farming|Organic]] apples are commonly produced in the United States.&lt;ref name=organic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/fruits/apples/organic-apples/ |title=Organic apples |access-date=23 February 2017 |publisher=USDA Agricultural Marketing Service |date=February 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224052612/http://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/fruits/apples/organic-apples/ |archive-date=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe.&lt;ref name="croplife"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://croplife.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf_files/European-Organic-apple-production-demonstrates-the-value-of-pesticides.pdf |title=European Organic Apple Production Demonstrates the Value of Pesticides |date=December 2011 |publisher=CropLife Foundation, Washington, DC |access-date=23 February 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224054210/https://croplife.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf_files/European-Organic-apple-production-demonstrates-the-value-of-pesticides.pdf |archive-date=24 February 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts ([[pyrethrum]], [[neem]]) has been approved by the EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality.&lt;ref name=croplife/&gt; A light coating of [[kaolin]], which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.&lt;ref name=app4/&gt;

===Phytochemicals===
Apple skins and seeds contain various [[phytochemical]]s, particularly [[polyphenol]]s which are under preliminary research for their potential health effects.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ribeiro FA, Gomes de Moura CF, ((Aguiar O Jr)), de Oliveira F, Spadari RC, Oliveira NR, Oshima CT, Ribeiro DA |title=The chemopreventive activity of apple against carcinogenesis: antioxidant activity and cell cycle control |journal=European Journal of Cancer Prevention |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=477–80 |date=September 2014 |pmid=24366437 |doi=10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000005 |s2cid=23026644 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-browning apples===
The [[enzyme]] [[polyphenol oxidase]] causes [[Food browning|browning]] in sliced or bruised apples, by [[catalysis|catalyzing]] the [[redox|oxidation]] of phenolic compounds to [[o-quinone]]s, a browning factor.&lt;ref name="nic"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Nicolas|first1=J.

===Research===
Preliminary research is investigating whether apple consumption may affect the risk of some types of cancer.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fabiani |first1=R |last2=Minelli |first2=L |last3=Rosignoli |first3=P |title=Apple intake and cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. |journal=Public Health Nutrition |date=October 2016 |volume=19 |issue=14 |pages=2603–17 |doi=10.1017/S136898001600032X |pmid=27000627|pmc=10270999 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allergy===
One form of apple allergy, often found in northern Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome and is found in people who are also allergic to [[birch]] [[pollen]].&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail [[oral allergy syndrome]] (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat,&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; but in rare cases can also include life-threatening [[anaphylaxis]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau, Elizabeth, [http://articles.cnn.com/2009-04-08/health/oral.allergy.syndrome_1_allergy-shots-pollen-allergies-oral-allergy-syndrome?_s=PM:HEALTH Oral allergy syndrome may explain mysterious reactions]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215000907/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-04-08/health/oral.allergy.syndrome_1_allergy-shots-pollen-allergies-oral-allergy-syndrome?_s=PM%3AHEALTH |date=15 December 2011 }}, 8 April 2009, ''CNN Health'', accessed 17 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.&lt;ref name=EU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foodallergens.ifr.ac.uk/food.lasso?selected_food=2#summary |title=General Information – Apple |publisher=Informall |access-date=17 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723201454/http://foodallergens.ifr.ac.uk/food.lasso?selected_food=2 |archive-date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, such as the Mediterranean, some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and [[urticaria]], and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals cannot eat raw or cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;

Breeding efforts have yet to produce a [[hypoallergenic]] fruit suitable for either of the two forms of apple allergy.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;

===Toxicity of seeds===
Apple seeds contain small amounts of [[amygdalin]], a sugar and [[cyanide]] compound known as a [[Cyanogenic glycoside#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycoside]]. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds causes no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause [[adverse reaction]]s. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be [[hydrolyzed]] before the cyanide ion is released.&lt;ref name="NelsonShih2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nelson, Lewis S. |author2=Shih, Richard D. |author3=Balick, Michael J. |title=Handbook of poisonous and injurious plants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-J-YxItyrHEC&amp;pg=PA211 |access-date=13 April 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-33817-0 |pages=211–212 |archive-date=9 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509140843/http://books.google.com/books?id=-J-YxItyrHEC&amp;pg=PA211 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[National Library of Medicine]]'s [[Hazardous Substances Data Bank]] records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+3559 |title=Amygdalin |publisher=Toxnet, US Library of Medicine |access-date=20 April 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421094516/https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+3559 |archive-date=21 April 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''train''' (from [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|trahiner}}, from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|trahere}}, "to pull, to draw"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of ''train (noun)'' in Compact OED |website=AskOxford.com |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/train?view=uk |access-date=18 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050526072449/http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/train?view=uk |archive-date=26 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a series of connected [[vehicle]]s that run along a [[railway track]] and [[Passenger train|transport people]] or [[Rail freight transport|freight]]. Trains are typically pulled or pushed by [[locomotive]]s (often known simply as "engines"), though some are self-propelled, such as [[multiple unit]]s. Passengers and cargo are carried in [[railroad car]]s, also known as wagons. Trains are designed to a certain [[Track gauge|gauge]], or distance between rails. Most trains operate on [[steel]] tracks with steel wheels, the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport.

Trains have their roots in [[wagonway]]s, which used railway tracks and were [[Horsecar|powered by horses]] or [[Cable railway|pulled by cables]]. Following the invention of the [[steam locomotive]] in the United Kingdom in 1804, trains rapidly spread around the world, allowing freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before. [[Rapid transit]] and [[tram]]s were first built in the late 1800s to transport large numbers of people in and around cities. Beginning in the 1920s, and accelerating following [[World War II]], [[Diesel locomotive|diesel]] and [[electric locomotive]]s replaced steam as the means of motive power. Following the development of [[car]]s, [[truck]]s, and extensive networks of [[highway]]s which offered greater mobility, as well as faster [[airplane]]s, trains declined in importance and market share, and many rail lines were abandoned. The spread of [[bus]]es led to the closure of many rapid transit and tram systems during this time as well.

Since the 1970s, governments, [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]], and train advocates have promoted increased use of trains due to their greater [[fuel efficiency]] and lower [[greenhouse gas emissions]] compared to other modes of land transport. [[High-speed rail]], first built in the 1960s, has proven competitive with cars and planes over short to medium distances. [[Commuter rail]] has grown in importance since the 1970s as an alternative to congested highways and a means to promote [[Transit-oriented development|development]], as has [[light rail]] in the 21st century. Freight trains remain important for the transport of bulk commodities such as coal and grain, as well as being a means of reducing road traffic congestion by freight trucks.

While conventional trains operate on relatively flat tracks with two rails, a number of specialized trains exist which are significantly different in their mode of operation. [[Monorail]]s operate on a single rail, while [[funicular]]s and [[rack railway]]s are uniquely designed to traverse steep slopes. Experimental trains such as high speed [[maglev]]s, which use [[magnetic levitation]] to float above a guideway, are under development in the 2020s{{Update after|2030|1|1}} and offer higher speeds than even the fastest conventional trains. Trains which use [[alternative fuel]]s such as [[Natural gas vehicle|natural gas]] and [[Hydrail|hydrogen]] are another 21st-century development.

Trains are an evolution of wheeled wagons running on stone [[wagonway]]s, the earliest of which were built by [[Babylon]] circa 2,200 BCE.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=8}} Starting in the 1500s, wagonways were introduced to haul material from mines; from the 1790s, stronger iron rails were introduced.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=8}} Following early developments in the second half of the 1700s, in 1804 a steam locomotive built by British inventor [[Richard Trevithick]] powered the first ever steam train.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=9}} Outside of coal mines, where fuel was less readily available, steam locomotives remained untried until the opening of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825. British engineer [[George Stephenson]] ran a steam locomotive named [[Locomotion No. 1]] on this {{Convert|25|mi|km|abbr=none|adj=on|sp=us|order=flip}} long line, hauling over 400 passengers at up to {{Convert|8|mph|km/h|sp=us|order=flip}}. The success of this locomotive, and [[Stephenson's Rocket]] in 1829, convinced many of the value in steam locomotives, and within a decade the [[stock market bubble]] known as "[[Railway Mania]]" started across the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Herring|2000|pp=9-11}}

News of the success of steam locomotives quickly reached the United States, where the first steam railroad opened in 1829.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=12}} American railroad pioneers soon started manufacturing their own locomotives, designed to handle the sharper curves and rougher track typical of the country's railroads.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=12-13}}[[File:Union Pacific Big Boy 4014 Departing Las Vegas, NV, October 8th, 2019.jpg|thumb|The [[Union Pacific Big Boy]] locomotives represented the pinnacle of steam locomotive technology and power.]]The other nations of [[Europe]] also took note of British railway developments, and most countries on the continent constructed and opened their first railways in the 1830s and 1840s, following the first run of a steam train in France in late 1829.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=14-15}} In the 1850s, trains continued to expand across Europe, with many influenced by or purchases of American locomotive designs.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=14-15}} Other European countries pursued their own distinct designs. Around the world, steam locomotives grew larger and more powerful throughout the rest of the century as technology advanced.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=15}}

Trains first entered service in South America, Africa, and Asia through construction by [[Imperialism|imperial powers]], which, starting in the 1840s, built railways to solidify control of their colonies and to transport cargo for export.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=16-17}} In Japan, which was never colonized, railways first arrived in the early 1870s. By 1900, railways were operating on every continent besides uninhabited Antarctica.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=17}}

=== New technologies ===
Even as steam locomotive technology continued to improve, inventors in [[Germany]] started work on alternative methods for powering trains. [[Werner von Siemens]] built the first train powered by electricity in 1879, and went on to pioneer electric [[tram]]s.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=15}} Another German inventor, [[Rudolf Diesel]], constructed the first [[diesel engine]] in the 1890s, though the potential of his invention to power trains was not realized until decades later.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=15}} Between 1897 and 1903, tests of experimental electric locomotives on the [[Royal Prussian Military Railway]] in Germany demonstrated they were viable, setting speed records in excess of {{Convert|100|mph|km/h|sp=us|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=20-21}}[[File:Locomotora_FSBC_2203.jpg|thumb|The [[EMD FT]] set the stage for diesel locomotives to take over from steam.]]Early gas powered "[[Doodlebug (rail car)|doodlebug]]" self-propelled railcars entered service on railroads in the first decade of the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schafer|first=Mike|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38738930|title=Vintage diesel locomotives|date=1998|publisher=Motorbooks International|isbn=0-7603-0507-2|location=Osceola, WI|pages=10–12|oclc=38738930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimentation with diesel and gas power continued, culminating in the German "[[DRG Class SVT 877|Flying Hamburger]]" in 1933, and the influential American [[EMD FT]] in 1939.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=20-22}} These successful diesel locomotives showed that diesel power was superior to steam, due to lower costs, ease of maintenance, and better reliability.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=20-23}} Meanwhile, Italy developed an extensive network of electric trains during the first decades of the 20th century, driven by that country's lack of significant coal reserves.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=20-21}}

=== Dieselization and increased competition ===
[[World War II]] brought great destruction to existing railroads across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Following the war's conclusion in 1945, nations which had suffered extensive damage to their railroad networks took the opportunity provided by [[Marshall Plan]] funds (or economic assistance from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and [[Comecon]], for nations behind the [[Iron Curtain]]) and advances in technology to convert their trains to diesel or electric power.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=22-24}} France, Russia, Switzerland, and Japan were leaders in adopting widespread electrified railroads, while other nations focused primarily on [[Dieselisation|dieselization]].{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=23-24}} By 1980, the majority of the world's steam locomotives had been retired, though they continued to be used in parts of Africa and Asia, along with a few holdouts in Europe and South America.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=22-23}} China was the last country to fully dieselize, due to its abundant coal reserves; steam locomotives were used to haul mainline trains as late as 2005 in [[Inner Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Don|last2=French|first2=Howard W.|date=2005-11-06|title=Last great steam railroad nears end of line|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/world/asia/last-great-steam-railroad-nears-end-of-line.html|access-date=2021-11-06|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trains began to face strong competition from automobiles and freight trucks in the 1930s, which greatly intensified following World War II.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=23}} After the war, air transport also became a significant competitor for passenger trains. Large amounts of traffic shifted to these new forms of transportation, resulting in a widespread decline in train service, both freight and passenger.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=23-24}} A new development in the 1960s was [[high-speed rail]], which runs on dedicated rights of way and travels at speeds of {{Convert|150|mph|km/h|sp=us|order=flip}} or greater. The first high-speed rail service was the Japanese [[Shinkansen]], which entered service in 1964.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=23-25}} In the following decades, high speed rail networks were developed across much of Europe and Eastern Asia, providing fast and reliable service competitive with automobiles and airplanes.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=23-25}} The first high-speed train in the Americas was [[Amtrak]]'s [[Acela]] in the United States, which entered service in 2000.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=25}}
[[File:Fuxinghao CR400 high-speed train front.jpg|thumb|China operates an extensive high speed rail network.]]

=== To the present day ===
Towards the end of the 20th century, increased awareness of the benefits of trains for transport led to a revival in their use and importance. Freight trains are significantly more efficient than trucks, while also emitting far fewer greenhouse gas emissions per ton-mile; passenger trains are also far more energy efficient than other modes of transport. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], "On average, rail requires 12 times less energy and emits 7–11 times less [[Greenhouse gas|GHGs]] per passenger-km travelled than private vehicles and airplanes, making it the most efficient mode of motorised passenger transport. Aside from shipping, freight rail is the most energy-efficient and least carbon-intensive way to transport goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=January 7, 2022|title=Rail - Fuels &amp; Technologies|url=https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/rail|access-date=2022-01-23|website=IEA}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, rail transport is considered an important part of achieving [[sustainable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=January 2019|title=The Future of Rail – Analysis|url=https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail|access-date=2021-11-05|website=IEA|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intermodal freight transport|Intermodal]] freight trains, carrying [[Double-stack rail transport|double-stack]] [[shipping container]]s, have since the 1970s generated significant business for railroads and gained market share from trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Blaze|first=Jim|date=2020-01-02|title=Will Short-Haul Rail Intermodal Ever Work?|url=https://www.railwayage.com/freight/will-short-haul-rail-intermodal-ever-work/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Railway Age|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased use of commuter rail has also been promoted as a means of fighting [[traffic congestion]] on highways in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Associated Press|date=August 6, 2002|title=Shore Line East ridership is up|work=[[Record-Journal]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7JbAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|access-date=November 5, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types and terminology ==
[[File:Claude Monet - Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare]]'', by [[Claude Monet]], 1877, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
Trains can be sorted into types based on whether they haul passengers or freight (though [[mixed train]]s which haul both exist), by their weight ([[heavy rail]] for regular trains, [[light rail]] for lighter rapid transit systems), by their speed, and by what form of track they use. Conventional trains operate on two rails, but several other types of track systems are also in use around the world.

=== Terminology ===
The [[railway terminology]] that is used to describe a train varies between countries. The two primary systems of terminology are [[International Union of Railways]] terms in much of the world, and [[Association of American Railroads]] terms in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= |first= |date= |title=Terminology |url=https://uic.org/support-activities/terminology/ |access-date=2021-11-05 |website=UIC - International union of railways |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web |title=CSX.com - Railroad Dictionary |url=https://www.csx.com/index.cfm/about-us/company-overview/railroad-dictionary/ |access-date=2021-11-05 |website=csx.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trains are typically defined as one or more locomotives coupled together, with or without cars. A collection of passenger or freight carriages connected together (not necessarily with a locomotive) is (especially in [[British English|British]] and [[Indian English]]) typically referred to as a [[rake (train)|rake]]. A collection of rail vehicles may also be called a '''consist'''. A set of vehicles that are permanently or semi-permanently coupled together (such as the [[Pioneer Zephyr]]) is called a '''trainset'''. The term rolling stock is used to describe any kind of train vehicle.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Components ==

=== Bogies ===
[[File:Railroad truck, FM55-20.Fig8-8.png|thumb|US-style railroad truck (bogie) with [[journal bearing]]s]]
{{Main|Bogie}}
Bogies, also known in North America as trucks, support the wheels and axles of trains. Trucks range from just one axle to as many as four or more. Two-axle trucks are in the widest use worldwide, as they are better able to handle curves and support heavy loads than single axle trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Okamoto|first=Isao|date=December 1998|title=How Bogies Work|url=https://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr18/pdf/f52_technology.pdf|access-date=November 4, 2021|website=Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Couplers ===
{{Main|Railway coupling}}
Train vehicles are linked to one another by various systems of coupling. In much of Europe, India, and South America, trains primarily use [[buffers and chain coupler]]s, while in the rest of the world [[Janney coupler|knuckle couplers]] are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016-12-27|title=Mechanical focus: couplers|url=https://www.railwayage.com/mechanical/freight-cars/mechanical-couplers/|access-date=2021-11-04|website=Railway Age|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wagner|first1=Simon|last2=Cole|first2=Colin|last3=Spiryagin|first3=Maksym|date=2021-06-01|title=A review on design and testing methodologies of modern freight train draft gear system|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s40534-021-00237-y|journal=Railway Engineering Science|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=127–151|doi=10.1007/s40534-021-00237-y|s2cid=236335052|issn=2662-4753|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brakes ===
{{Main|Railway air brake}}
Because trains are heavy, powerful brakes are needed to slow or stop trains, and because steel wheels on steel rails have relatively low friction, brakes must be distributed among as many wheels as possible. Early trains could only be stopped by manually applied hand brakes, requiring workers to ride on top of the cars and apply the brakes when the train went downhill. Hand brakes are still used to park cars and locomotives, but the predominant braking system for trains globally is air brakes, invented in 1869 by [[George Westinghouse]]. Air brakes are applied at once to the entire train using air hoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Herkewitz|first=William|date=2013-07-10|title=Understanding a Runaway Train: How Do Air Brakes Work?|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/understanding-a-runaway-train-how-do-air-brakes-work-15678938|access-date=2021-11-04|website=Popular Mechanics|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warning devices ===
[[File:GO Train Georgetown 5 (cropped).jpg|thumb|This cab car includes a horn (top), a bell (top right), headlights (above the door), classification lights (red lights on side), and ditch lights (white lights on side).]]
For safety and communication, trains are equipped with [[bell]]s, [[Train horn|horns]], and [[Train lights|lights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Train Horn|url=https://www.bnsf.com/in-the-community/safety-and-security/train-horn.page|access-date=2021-11-04|website=BNSF Railway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Weart|first=Ray|date=October 10, 2019|title=Ask Trains: What are the rules on when locomotive bells should ring?|url=https://www.trains.com/trn/train-basics/ask-trains/ask-trains-what-are-the-rules-on-when-locomotive-bells-should-ring/|access-date=2021-11-04|website=Trains|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steam locomotives typically use [[steam whistle]]s rather than horns.

=== Cabs ===
Locomotives are in most cases equipped with cabs, also known as driving compartments, where a [[train driver]] controls the train's operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wiedrich|first=Bob|date=May 27, 1990|title=ALL THE COMFORTS OF A-LOCOMOTIVE CAB|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-05-27-9002130133-story.html|access-date=2021-11-05|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be installed on unpowered train cars known as [[Control car|cab or control cars]], to allow for a train to operate with the locomotive at the rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Comet I Commuter Coaches|url=http://www.whippanyrailwaymuseum.net/exhibits/equipment/passenger-cars/comet-i-commuter-coaches|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Whippany Railway Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
{{Main|Rail transport operations}}

=== Scheduling and dispatching ===
To prevent collisions or other accidents, trains are often scheduled, and almost always are under the control of [[train dispatcher]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=March 23, 2021|title=How Does Train Dispatching Work?|url=http://www.up.com/up/customers/track-record/tr030921-how-does-train-dispatching-work.htm|access-date=2021-11-04|website=www.up.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, trains operated based on [[Public transport timetable|timetables]]; most passenger trains continue to operate based on fixed schedules, though freight trains may instead run on an as-needed basis, or when enough freight cars are available to justify running a train.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lester|first=David C.|date=February 1, 2018|title=Scheduling freight trains|url=https://www.trains.com/trn/train-basics/abcs-of-railroading/scheduling-freight-trains/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Trains|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
[[File:Metro-North_Bronx_track_work_continues_(9515218549).jpg|thumb|A number of maintenance vehicles at work on [[Metro-North Railroad]]]]
Simple repairs may be done while a train is parked on the tracks, but more extensive repairs will be done at a [[motive power depot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Guss|first=Chris|date=March 1, 2018|title=Where diesels go to the doctor|url=https://www.trains.com/trn/train-basics/abcs-of-railroading/where-diesels-go-to-the-doctor/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Trains|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar facilities exist for repairing damaged or defective train cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Luther|first=Darrel|date=2014-09-22|title=Maintaining Railcars|url=https://wasteadvantagemag.com/maintaining-railcars/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Waste Advantage Magazine|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maintenance of way]] trains are used to build and repair railroad tracks and other equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Solomon|first=Brian|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46976669|title=Railway maintenance equipment|date=2001|publisher=MBI Pub.

[[Train driver]]s, also known as engineers, are responsible for operating trains.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sperandeo|first=Andy|date=May 1, 2006|title=The people who work on trains|url=https://www.trains.com/trn/train-basics/abcs-of-railroading/the-people-who-work-on-trains/|access-date=2021-11-04|website=Trains|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conductor (rail)|Conductors]] are in charge of trains and their cargo, and help passengers on passenger trains.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Brakeman]], also known as trainmen, were historically responsible for manually applying brakes, though the term is used today to refer to crew members who perform tasks such as operating switches, coupling and uncoupling train cars, and setting handbrakes on equipment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Steam locomotives require a [[Fireman (steam engine)|fireman]] who is responsible for fueling and regulating the locomotive's fire and boiler.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On passenger trains, other crew members assist passengers, such as chefs to prepare food, and service attendants to provide food and drinks to passengers. Other passenger train specific duties include passenger car attendants, who assist passengers with boarding and alighting from trains, answer questions, and keep train cars clean, and sleeping car attendants, who perform similar duties in [[sleeping car]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Gauge ===
[[File:Narrow_gauge_railroad_-_Geriatriezentrum_Lainz_22.jpg|thumb|A narrow gauge train in [[Austria]]]]
Around the world, various [[track gauge]]s are in use for trains. In most cases, trains can only operate on tracks that are of the same gauge; where different gauge trains meet, it is known as a [[break of gauge]]. [[Standard-gauge railway|Standard gauge]], defined as {{convert|4|ft|8.5|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} between the rails, is the most common gauge worldwide, though both [[Broad-gauge railway|broad-gauge]] and [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] trains are also in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hilton|first=George W.|date=May 1, 2006|title=A history of track gauge|url=https://www.trains.com/trn/railroads/history/a-history-of-track-gauge/|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Trains|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trains also need to fit within the [[loading gauge]] profile to avoid fouling bridges and lineside infrastructure with this being a potential limiting factor on loads such as [[intermodal container]] types that may be carried.&lt;ref name="IRJ"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Burroughs|first=David|date=15 October 2018|title=Network Rail to increase loading gauge on Doncaster – Immingham Line|magazine=International Railway Journal|url-access=limited|access-date=8 November 2021|archive-date=8 November 2021|url=https://www.railjournal.com/infrastructure/network-rail-to-increase-loading-gauge-on-doncaster-immingham-line/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20211108225553/https://www.railjournal.com/infrastructure/network-rail-to-increase-loading-gauge-on-doncaster-immingham-line/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
[[File:Derailment_Repair_(4213647132).jpg|thumb|Most derailments, such as this one in [[Switzerland]], are minor and do not cause injuries or damage.]]
Train accidents sometimes occur, including [[derailment]]s (when a train leaves the tracks) and [[train wreck]]s (collisions between trains). Accidents were more common in the early days of trains, when [[railway signal]] systems, [[centralized traffic control]], and failsafe systems to prevent collisions were primitive or did not yet exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McDonald|first=Charles W.|date=August 1993|title=The Federal Railroad Safety Program|url=https://railroads.dot.gov/sites/fra.dot.gov/files/fra_net/16422/1993_THE%20FEDERAL%20RAILROAD%20SAFETY%20PROGRAM%20-%20100%20YEARS%20OF.PDF|access-date=November 5, 2021|website=Federal Railroad Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent accidents, systems such as [[automatic train stop]] are used; these are failsafe systems that apply the brakes on a train if it passes a red signal and enters an occupied [[Block signal|block]], or if any of the train's equipment malfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=September 1, 1925|title=Meriden In Safety Zone - New Train Stop System Installed|page=4|work=[[The Meriden Daily Journal]]|location=Meriden, Connecticut|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7hIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|access-date=January 20, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; More advanced safety systems, such as [[positive train control]], can also automatically regulate train speed, preventing derailments from entering curves or switches too fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=September 9, 2021|title=Positive Train Control (PTC)|url=https://railroads.dot.gov/train-control/ptc/positive-train-control-ptc|access-date=January 20, 2022|website=[[Federal Railroad Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern trains have a very good safety record overall, comparable with air travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Elliott|first=Christopher|date=May 24, 2015|title=Amtrak 188 crash: How safe are America's trains?|url=https://fortune.com/2015/05/14/amtrak-trains-safe/|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Fortune|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States between 2000 and 2009, train travel averaged 0.43 deaths per billion passenger miles traveled.

The vast majority of train-related fatalities, over 90 percent, are due to trespassing on railroad tracks, or collisions with road vehicles at [[level crossing]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Safety and Trespass Prevention {{!}} FRA|url=https://railroads.dot.gov/highway-rail-crossing-and-trespasser-programs/railroad-crossing-safety-trespass|access-date=2021-11-06|website=railroads.dot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as [[Operation Lifesaver]] have been formed to improve safety awareness at railroad crossings, and governments have also launched ad campaigns. Trains cannot stop quickly when at speed; even an emergency brake application may still require more than a mile of stopping distance. As such, emphasis is on educating motorists to yield to trains at crossings and avoid trespassing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Stop. Trains Can't.

Steam locomotives work by using a boiler to heat water into steam, which powers the locomotive's pistons which are in turn connected to the wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McGonigal|first=Robert S.|date=May 1, 2006|title=How a steam locomotive works|url=https://www.trains.com/trn/train-basics/abcs-of-railroading/how-a-steam-locomotive-works/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Trains|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 20th century, most steam locomotives were replaced by diesel or electric locomotives, which were cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Nilsson|first=Jeff|date=2013-05-11|title=Why You Don't See Steam Locomotives Anymore|url=https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2013/05/locomotive-diesel-engine/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=The Saturday Evening Post|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steam locomotives are still used in [[heritage railway]]s operated in many countries for the leisure and enthusiast market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Minor and Heritage Railways|url=http://orr.gov.uk/about-orr/who-we-work-with/railway-networks/minor-and-heritage-railways|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222044131/http://orr.gov.uk/about-orr/who-we-work-with/railway-networks/minor-and-heritage-railways|archive-date=February 22, 2018|access-date=November 4, 2021|website=orr.gov.uk|publisher=Office of Rail and Road}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diesel ===
Diesel locomotives are powered with a diesel engine, which generates electricity to drive traction motors. This is known as a [[diesel–electric transmission]], and is used on almost all diesels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2014|title=Diesel Electric Locomotives|url=https://edisontechcenter.org/Dieseltrains.html|access-date=2021-11-05|website=edisontechcenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diesel power replaced steam for a variety of reasons: diesel locomotives were less complex, far more reliable, cheaper, cleaner, easier to maintain, and more fuel efficient.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Electric ===
[[Image:SwissMGB.jpg|thumbnail|Swiss Electric locomotive at [[Brig, Switzerland]]]]Electric trains receive their current via [[overhead lines]] or through a [[Third rail|third rail electric system]], which is then used to power traction motors that drive the wheels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Electric traction offers a lower cost per mile of train operation but at a higher initial cost, which can only be justified on high traffic lines. Even though the cost per mile of construction is much higher, electric traction is cheaper to operate thanks to lower maintenance and purchase costs for locomotives and equipment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Compared to diesel locomotives, electric locomotives produce no direct emissions and accelerate much faster, making them better suited to passenger service, especially underground.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hickman|first=Leo|date=2012-07-16|title=How green are electric trains?|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/jul/16/electric-trains-diesel-green-carbon|access-date=2021-11-05|website=The Guardian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other types ===
[[File:Union_Pacific_third_generation_GTEL_locomotive.JPG|thumb|A [[gas turbine locomotive]] operated by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]]]
{{See also|Alternative fuel locomotive}}
Various other types of train propulsion have been tried, some more successful than others.

In the mid 1900s, [[gas turbine locomotive]]s were developed and successfully used, though most were retired due to high fuel costs and poor reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About Gas Turbine Locomotives|url=http://www.up.com/up/aboutup/special_trains/gas-turbine/index.htm|access-date=2021-11-05|website=www.up.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, alternative fuels for locomotives are under development, due to increasing costs for diesel and a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from trains. Examples include [[hydrail]] (trains powered by hydrogen fuel cells) and the use of compressed or [[liquefied natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Clinnick|first=Robert|date=October 21, 2021|title=Worldwide hydrogen projects gain traction|url=https://www.railjournal.com/in_depth/worldwide-hydrogen-projects-gain-traction/|access-date=2021-11-07|website=International Railway Journal|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Vantuono|first=William C.|date=2021-11-01|title=CP: Green 'Gas 'n Go' Gets Grant|url=https://www.railwayage.com/mechanical/locomotives/cp-green-gas-n-go-gets-grant/|access-date=2021-11-07|website=Railway Age|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Train cars ==
{{Main|Railroad car}}
[[File:BNSF_Railway_Classification_Yard,_South_of_Galesburg,_IL_(3).jpg|thumb|Various types of railroad cars in a [[classification yard]] in the United States]]
Train cars, also known as wagons, are unpowered rail vehicles which are typically pulled by locomotives. Many different types exist, specialized to handle various types of cargo. Some common types include [[boxcar]]s (also known as [[covered goods wagon]]s) that carry a wide variety of cargo, [[flatcar]]s (also known as [[flat wagon]]s) which have flat tops to hold cargo, [[hopper car]]s which carry bulk commodities, and [[tank car]]s which carry liquids and gases. Examples of more specialized types of train cars include [[Ladle transfer car|bottle cars]] which hold molten steel,&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schafer|first=Mike|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41002704|title=Freight train cars|date=1999|publisher=MBI Pub|others=Mike McBride|isbn=0-7603-0612-5|location=Osceola, Wis.|pages=11–13, 93, 95|oclc=41002704}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schnabel car]]s which handle very heavy loads, and [[refrigerator car]]s which carry perishable goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rail Car Types Defined|url=http://www.up.com/up/customers/track-record/tr181121_rail_car_types.htm|access-date=2021-11-05|website=www.up.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Vantuono|first=William C.|date=2012-06-14|title=Kasgro builds "World's Largest Railroad Car"|url=https://www.railwayage.com/mechanical/freight-cars/kasgro-builds-worlds-largest-railroad-car/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Railway Age|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early train cars were small and light, much like early locomotives, but over time they have become larger as locomotives have become more powerful.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Passenger trains ==
{{Main|Passenger train}}
[[File:Shenzhen_Guangzhou_high_speed_train_new_rolling_stock_China_(37116926035).jpg|thumb|Second-class compartment of a [[China Railways CRH1|China Railways CRH1A-A]] train]]
A passenger train is used to transport people along a railroad line. These trains may consist of unpowered [[passenger railroad car]]s (also known as coaches or carriages) hauled by one or more locomotives, or may be self-propelled; self propelled passenger trains are known as [[multiple unit]]s or [[railcar]]s. Passenger trains travel between [[train station|stations or depots]], where passengers may board and disembark. In most cases, passenger trains operate on a fixed [[Public transport timetable|schedule]] and have priority over [[freight train]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Freight Delays and Your Amtrak Service|url=https://www.amtrak.com/on-time-performance|access-date=2021-11-05|website=www.amtrak.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passenger trains can be divided into short and long distance services.

=== Long distance trains ===
{{Main|Inter-city rail}}
Long distance passenger trains travel over hundreds or even thousands of miles between cities. The longest passenger train service in the world is Russia's [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] between [[Moscow]] and [[Vladivostok]], a distance of {{Convert|5772|mi|km|sp=us|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Warren|first=Katie|date=January 3, 2020|title=I rode the legendary Trans-Siberian Railway on a 2,000-mile journey across 4 time zones in Russia.

For many rural communities, they are the only form of public transportation available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Jaffe|first=Eric|date=April 18, 2013|title=3 Reasons to Keep Amtrak's Long-Distance Trains Running|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-18/3-reasons-to-keep-amtrak-s-long-distance-trains-running|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Short distance trains ===
Short distance or [[Regional rail|regional]] passenger trains have travel times measured in hours or even minutes, as opposed to days. They run more frequently than long distance trains, and are often used by commuters. Short distance passenger trains specifically designed for commuters are known as [[commuter rail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Zipper|first=David|date=April 30, 2020|title=Will Commuters Ever Go Back to Commuter Trains?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-30/will-commuters-ever-go-back-to-commuter-trains|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High speed trains ===
{{Main|High-speed rail}}
[[File:Shinkansen_0series_(4424654951).jpg|thumb|The Japanese [[0 Series Shinkansen]] pioneered high speed rail service.]]High speed trains are designed to be much faster than conventional trains, and typically run on their own separate tracks than other, slower trains. The first high speed train was the Japanese [[Shinkansen]], which opened in 1964.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=134-135}} In the 21st century, services such as the French [[TGV]] and German [[Intercity Express]] are competitive with airplanes in travel time over short to medium distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Bachman|first1=Justin|last2=Fan|first2=Richard|last3=Cannon|first3=Christopher|date=January 9, 2018|title=Watch Out, Airlines. High Speed Rail Now Rivals Flying on Key Routes|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-09/high-speed-rail-now-rivals-flying-on-key-global-routes|access-date=November 5, 2021|website=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subset of high speed trains are [[higher speed train]]s, which bridge the gap between conventional and high speed trains, and travel at speeds between the two. Examples include the [[Northeast Regional]] in the United States, the [[Gatimaan Express]] in India, and the [[KTM ETS]] in Malaysia.

== Rapid transit trains ==
A number of types of trains are used to provide [[rapid transit]] to urban areas. These are distinct from traditional passenger trains in that they operate more frequently, typically do not share tracks with freight trains, and cover relatively short distances. Many different kinds of systems are in use globally.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=138-139}}

Rapid transit trains that operate in tunnels below ground are known as subways, undergrounds, or metros. [[Elevated railway]]s operate on viaducts or bridges above the ground, often on top of city streets. "Metro" may also refer to rapid transit that operates at ground level. In many systems, two or even all three of these types may exist on different portions of a network.

=== Trams ===
{{Main|Tram}}
Trams, also known in North America as streetcars, typically operate on or parallel to streets in cities, with frequent stops and a high frequency of service.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kobie|first=Nicole|date=April 4, 2018|title=Trams are great for city transport – why doesn't the UK have more?|language=en-GB|magazine=Wired UK|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/trams-edinburgh-manchester-uk-transport-system|access-date=2021-11-05|issn=1357-0978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light rail ===
{{Main|Light rail}}
[[File:Škoda Artic Tampere.jpg|thumb|[[Škoda Artic]] light rail train near the cathedral in [[Tampere|Tampere, Finland]]]]
Light rail is a catchall term for a variety of systems, which may include characteristics of trams, passenger trains, and rapid transit systems.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Specialized trains ==
There are a number of specialized trains which differ from the traditional definition of a train as a set of vehicles which travels on two rails.

=== Monorail ===
[[File:Tokyo-Monorail-Type1000-1082F-EV.jpg|thumb|A [[Tokyo Monorail]] train]]
{{Main|Monorail}}

Monorails were developed to meet medium-demand traffic in urban transit, and consist of a train running on a single rail, typically elevated. Monorails represent a small proportion of the train systems in use worldwide. Almost all monorail trains use linear induction motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2013|title=Linear Motor Driven System|url=http://www.hitachi-rail.com/products/rolling_stock/linear/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930090347/http://www.hitachi-rail.com/products/rolling_stock/linear/index.html|archive-date=30 September 2018|access-date=23 June 2019|website=Hitachi-Rail.com|publisher=[[Hitachi|Hitachi, Ltd.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2015|title=Monorail|url=http://www.railsystem.net/monorail/|access-date=23 June 2019|website=RailSystem.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maglev ===
{{Main|Maglev}}
To achieve much faster operation over {{convert|310|mph|km/h|abbr=|sp=us|order=flip}}, maglev technology has been researched since the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Boslaugh|first=Sarah E.|title=maglev {{!}} Facts, Operation, &amp; Systems|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/maglev-train|access-date=2022-01-15|website=[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology uses magnets to levitate the train above the track, reducing friction and allowing higher speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=June 24, 2016|title=How Maglev Works|url=https://www.energy.gov/articles/how-maglev-works|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Energy.gov|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial maglev train was an [[airport shuttle]] introduced in 1984 at [[Birmingham Airport]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2010-11-17|title=Birmingham Airport's old Maglev carriage to be sold|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-11780663|access-date=2021-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mine trains ===
{{Main|Mine railway}}

Mine trains are operated in large mines and carry both workers and goods. They are usually powered by electricity, to prevent emissions which would pose a health risk to workers underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Moore|first=Paul|date=2020-05-24|title=China's mines rolling out unmanned underground rail systems at a rapid pace|url=https://im-mining.com/2020/05/24/chinas-mines-rolling-unmanned-underground-rail-systems-rapid-pace/|access-date=2021-11-08|website=International Mining|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scale_2401.jpg|thumb|A preserved armored train]]

=== Militarized trains ===

=== Rack railway ===
{{Main|Rack railway}}
For climbing steep slopes, specialized rack railroads are used. In order to avoid slipping, a [[rack and pinion]] system is used, with a toothed rail placed between the two regular rails, which meshes with a drive gear under the locomotive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Fred|last2=Frick|first2=Martin R.|date=May 24, 1976|title=The Pike's Peak Cog Railway Colorado Springs, Colorado: A National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark|url=https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/16-manitou-and-pikes-peak-cog-railway.pdf|access-date=November 5, 2021|website=American Society of Mechanical Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funicular ===
{{Main|Funicular}}
Funiculars are also used to climb steep slopes, but instead of a rack use a rope, which is attached to two cars and a pulley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What Is a Funicular Railway|url=https://ridetheincline.com/what-is-a-funicular-railway/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Incline Railway|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two funicular cars travel up and down the slope on parallel sets of rails when the pulley is rotated.

Under the right circumstances, transporting freight by train is less expensive than other modes of transport, and also more energy efficient than transporting freight by road. In the United States, railroads on average moved a ton of freight {{Convert|436|mi|km|sp=us|order=flip}} per gallon of fuel, as of 2008, an efficiency four times greater than that of trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Jackson|first=Brooks|date=2008-07-01|title=Fuel Efficient Freight Trains?|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2008/07/fuel-efficient-freight-trains/|access-date=2021-11-01|website=FactCheck.org|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Freight Rail Overview {{!}} FRA|url=https://railroads.dot.gov/rail-network-development/freight-rail-overview|access-date=2021-11-01|website=railroads.dot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environmental and Energy Study Institute]] estimates that train transportation of freight is between 1.9 and 5.5 times more efficient than by truck, and also generates significantly less pollution.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Nunno|first=Richard|date=May 30, 2018|title=Electrification of U.S. Railways: Pie in the Sky, or Realistic Goal? {{!}} Article {{!}} EESI|url=https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/electrification-of-u.s.-railways-pie-in-the-sky-or-realistic-goal|access-date=2021-11-01|website=www.eesi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rail freight is most economic when goods are being carried in bulk and over large distances, but it is less suited to short distances and small loads.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the advent of [[containerization]], freight rail has become part of an [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal freight network]] linked with trucking and [[container ship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Stagl|first=Jeff|date=June 2008|title=Rail Insider-From dieselization to computerization to consolidation, freight railroads have made industry-shaping strides|url=https://www.progressiverailroading.com/federal_legislation_regulation/article/From-dieselization-to-computerization-to-consolidation-freight-railroads-have-made-industry-shaping-strides--17007|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Progressive Railroading|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main disadvantage of rail freight is its lack of flexibility and for this reason, rail has lost much of the freight business to [[road transport|road competition]]. Many governments are trying to encourage more freight back on to trains because of the community benefits that it would bring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2017|title=Benefits of using Rail Freight|url=https://www.transport.gov.scot/media/33630/transport-scotland-rail-freight-guide-web.pdf|access-date=November 5, 2021|website=Transport Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural impact ==

From the dawn of railroading, trains have had a significant cultural impact worldwide. Fast train travel made possible in days or hours journeys which previously took months. Transport of both freight and passengers became far cheaper, allowing for networked economies over large areas.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The effects of the railways - Transport — canals and railways - National 5 History Revision|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjy6rj6/revision/10|access-date=2021-11-06|website=BBC Bitesize|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towns and cities along railroad lines grew in importance, while those bypassed declined or even became [[ghost towns]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wolmar|first=Christian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7i0fXplIJEC&amp;q=how+railroads+grew+cities|title=The Great Railroad Revolution: The History of Trains in America|date=2012-09-25|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-61039-180-1|pages=217–221|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major cities such as [[Chicago]] became prominent because they were places where multiple train lines met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Koziarz|first=Jay|date=2017-09-21|title=Transportation that built Chicago: The railroads|url=https://chicago.curbed.com/2017/9/21/16344608/transportation-chicago-railroad-cta-union-station-history|access-date=2022-01-21|website=Curbed Chicago|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the completion of the [[first transcontinental railroad]] played a major role in the settling of [[Western United States|the western part of the nation]] by non-indigenous migrants and its incorporation into the rest of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Impact of the Transcontinental Railroad |work=American Experience |publisher= PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/tcrr-impact-transcontinental-railroad/|access-date=2021-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] had a similar impact by connecting the vast country from east to west, and making travel across the frozen [[Siberia]] possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Beauchamp|first=Zack|date=2016-10-05|title=The Trans-Siberian Railway reshaped world history|url=https://www.vox.com/world/2016/10/5/13167966/100th-anniversary-trans-siberian-railway-google-doodle|access-date=2021-11-07|website=Vox|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''box''' ([[plural]]: '''boxes''') is a [[container]] used for the storage or transportation of its contents. Most boxes have flat, parallel, rectangular sides. Boxes can be very small (like a [[matchbox]]) or very large (like a shipping box for furniture), and can be used for a variety of purposes from functional to decorative. 

Boxes may be made of a variety of materials, both durable, such as [[wood]] and [[metal]]; and non-durable, such as [[corrugated fiberboard]] and [[paperboard]]. Corrugated metal boxes are commonly used as [[shipping container]]s.

Most commonly, boxes have flat, parallel, rectangular sides, making them [[rectangular prism]]s; but boxes may also have other shapes. Rectangular prisms are often referred to colloquially as "boxes."

Boxes may be closed and shut with flaps, doors, or a separate lid. They can be secured shut with adhesives, tapes, or more decorative or elaborately functional mechanisms, such as a catch, [[fastener|clasp]] or [[lock (security device)|lock]].

==Types==
===Packaging===
Several types of boxes are used in [[packaging]] and storage.

* A [[corrugated box design|corrugated box]] is a [[shipping container]] made from [[corrugated fiberboard]], most commonly used to transport products from a warehouse during distribution. Corrugated boxes are also known as cartons, cases, and [[cardboard box]]es in various regions.  Corrugated boxes are rated based on the strength of their material or their carrying capacity. Corrugated boxes are also used as product packaging, or in [[point of sale]] displays. 
* [[Folding carton]]s (sometimes known as a box) are [[paperboard]] boxes manufactured with a folding lid. These are used to package a wide range of goods, and can be used for either one-time (non-resealable) usage, or as a storage box for more permanent use. Folding cartons are first printed (if necessary) before being [[Die (manufacturing)|die-cut]] and scored to form a blank; these are then transported and stored flat, before being constructed at the point of use.
** A [[gift box]] is a variant on the folding carton, used for birthday or [[Christmas]] [[gift]]s.
* Gable boxes are paperboard cartons used for liquids. 
* Setup boxes (also known as rigid paperboard boxes) are made of stiff paperboard and are permanently glued together with paper skins that can be printed or colored. Unlike folding cartons, these are assembled at the point of manufacture and transported as already constructed ("set-up"). Set up boxes are more expensive than folding boxes and are typically used for protecting high-value items such as cosmetics, watches or smaller consumer electronics.
* [[Crate]]s are heavy duty shipping containers. Originally made of wood, crates are distinct from [[wooden box]]es, also used as heavy-duty shipping containers, as a wooden container must have all six of its sides put in place to result in the rated strength of the container. The strength of a wooden box, on the other hand, is rated based on the weight it can carry before the top or opening is installed.
** A wooden wine box or wine crate, originally used for shipping and storing expensive wines, is a variant of the wooden box now used for decorative or promotional purposes, or as a storage box during shipping.
* [[Bulk box]]es are large boxes often used in industrial environments, sized to fit on a [[pallet]].
* An [[ammunition box]] is a metal can or box for ammunition.
Depending on locale and usage, the terms '''carton''' and '''box''' are sometimes used interchangeably. The invention of large steel [[intermodal shipping container]]s has helped advance the [[globalization]] of commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|title=Sample Chapter for Levinson, M.: The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger.|last=Levinson|first=Marc|work=[[The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|access-date=17 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122131825/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html#|archive-date=2013-01-22|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Gittins |first=Ross |date=2006-06-12 |title=How the invention of a box changed our world |url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/how-the-invention-of-a-box-changed-our-world-20060612-gdnqf0.html |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=The Sydney Morning Herald |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storage ===
{{See also|Decorative boxes}}
Boxes for storing various items in can often be very decorative, as they are intended for permanent use and sometimes are put on display in certain locations.

The following are some types of storage boxes :
* A jewelry ([[American English|AmE]]) or jewellery ([[British English|BrE]]) box, is a box for [[wikt:trinket|trinket]]s or [[Gemstone|jewel]]s. It can take a very modest form with paper covering and lining, covered in [[leather]] and lined with [[satin]], or be larger and more highly decorated.
* A [[hat box]] is used for storing or transporting a hat. Hat boxes are often cylindrical or oval.
* A [[humidor]] is a special box for storing cigars at the proper humidity.
* A "strong box" or [[safe]], is a secure lockable box for storing money or other valuable items. The term "strong box" is sometimes used for safes that are not portable but installed in a wall or floor.
* A [[toolbox]] is used for carrying tools of various kinds. They are usually used for portability rather than just storage. 
* A toy box is name of box for storing [[toys]].
* {{Anchor|Boxfile}} A box file is used in offices for storing papers and smaller files.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VRMPitXlPEC&amp;q=A+boxfile+is+used+in+offices+for+storing+papers+and+smaller+files&amp;pg=PA7|title=FCS Office Practice L3|last=Hewett|first=Gwen|date=2008|publisher=Pearson South Africa|isbn=9781770251274|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
